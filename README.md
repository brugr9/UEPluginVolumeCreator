Provides support for importing image stacks, for creating image-based texture volumes and for Direct Volume Rendering DVR in Real-time

## Description

This plugin enables image-based volume rendering from the Blueprint visual scripting system. The delivered assets provide rendering of CT and MRI data using shader software with transfer-functions from look-up tables or gradients. To speed up rendering, optimization techniques such as empty space skipping or early ray termination are used. The delivered assets also enable importing image stacks from the Blueprint visual scripting system.

## 1. Setup

### 1.1. Installation

In the Unreal Editor access the Plugin Editor from the menu 'Edit > Plugins'. In the Plugin Editor, under category 'Rendering' find and enable the plugin. Finally restart the Unreal Editor.

### 1.2. Project Configuration

To allow Volume Texture asset creation follow these steps as from Unreal Engine Documentation article [*Creating Volume Textures*](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/RenderingAndGraphics/Textures/VolumeTextures/CreatingVolumeTextures/):

> Before you can use Volume Textures in your Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) project, you will need to enable them. In the following How-To, we will take a look at setting up your UE4 project to use Volume Textures.
>
> 1. First, make sure that the Editor is closed, and then locate your project's DefaultEngine.ini file and open it.
> 2. Locate the Script/Engine.RendererSettings section and add the following variable, then save the file when you have added it:
>
> ```r.AllowVolumeTextureAssetCreation=1```
>
> 3. Re-launch the Editor

## 2. Usage

### 2.1. Concept

The following workflow is discussed as a basic concept. We use an actor with an actor component Static Mesh 'Cube'. The cube is assiged a volume rendering material with parameters as follows:

* **Volume**: TextureVolume from Image-Stack
* **Transfer Function**: Look-Up Table LUT (Texture2D) or Gradient (CurveLinearColor)
* **Shader**: Direct Volume Rendering DVR by Raycasting (unlit) or Raymarching (static lighting)

Depending on which parameters have been selected, additional parameters can be displayed.

<div style='page-break-after: always'></div>

### 2.2. Volumes

* Volumes from Image-Stack as Texture2D and TextureVolume
* Raymarching with precomputed static lighting
* Limitations: Saving is limited to `G8` or `G16`. The plugin does not support persistent 32bit grayscale textures to be saved.

#### 2.2.1. Default Volume

Default Volume, size of image-stack based volume:

* A Stack of 256 images of size 256 x 256 pixel per image = 256<sup>3</sup> pixel or voxel resp.
* Pixel depth: 4 channels (RGBA)
* With using 8 bit unsigned integer (`G8`, Range: From 0 to 255) this is 8 bit per channel
<!-- * The range per voxel is 4 x 2<sup>8</sup> = 1024 -->

```math
V = 256^3 \times 4 \times 8 bit = 64 MB
```

Please consider: If the images are double the size (stack of 512 images with 512 x 512 pixel per image), the size already increases to 0.5 GB:

```math
V = 512^3 \times 4 \times 8 bit = 512 MB
```

The volume has to be loaded to RAM and has to be processed every frame of, e.g., 30 fps, which is a huge amount of work to be done &ndash; even for nowadays graphics hardware. That's why we provide with a 256<sup>3</sup> voxel volume.

#### 2.2.2. Import dcm

DICOM dcm

#### 2.2.3. Import mhd

MetaImage mhd

<div style='page-break-after: always'></div>

### 2.3. Transfer Functions

Transfer Functions TF from Look-Up Tables LUT (Texture2D assets) or Gradients (CurveLinearColor assets)

#### 2.3.1. TF LUTs

Texture2D named `T_TF-LUT-[*]`

#### 2.3.2. TF Gradients

CurveLinearColor named `Curve_TF-[*]_Color`

<div style='page-break-after: always'></div>

### 2.4. Direct Volume Rendering

Direct Volume Rendering DVR Materials with Raycasting Shader or Raymarching Shader

#### 2.4.1 Raymarching Materials

DVR Material with Raymarching Shader

<div style='page-break-after: always'></div>

## 3. Showcase

The plugin folder 'Showcase' provides with two Blueprints `BP_Demo-DVR-TF-LUT` and `BP_Demo-DVR-TF-Gradient` as well as with two maps `Map_Demo-VolumeCreator`.

### 3.1. Desktop

With the level Map_Demo-DVR openned, from the Level Editor, click the Play button to Play-in-Editor PIE:

### 3.2. HMD VR

#### 3.2.1. Configure Input Bindings

Under `Project Settings > Engine > Input` push button `Import` and select file `VolumeCreator/Config/Input.ini`.

With these input settings configured, from VolumeCreator Content/Showcase/VR open Blueprint `BP_VRPawn`, find its Details Panel and edit entry 'VRPawn > Per Platform Controllers':

* Left Controller Class: `BP_LeftMotionController` (from dropdown)
* Right Controller Class: `BP_RightMotionController` (from dropdown)
